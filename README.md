EasyClassHelper
===================

An excellent class-management program for teachers.

Have you thought it is too hard too manage the exams or tests of your classes? Have you been tired to type the grades of students on Excel? Now your have an easier way: using ECH.

### What it can do

ECH can help you manage your classes easily. You can add your classes, students and exams into the program, and ECH will remember them. You can use ECH to see the rank list and the average score of a exam.

ECH also has some other functions. You can select a random student in the class (for example to answer a question), write courseware in HTML, and even run Python code (some teacher may need them).

See the wiki for more information.

### How to install

* Download a release version of ECH (not source code).
* Unzip the file "EasyClassHelper.zip", put it in anywhere you want.
* Open the unzipped folder, go into the "FILES" dir.
* run "ECH.exe"

Remember: You can create a shortcut for ECH.exe, but never move it, or the program will not run normally.

### This is a open-source project

Tell me if you have some ideas to make ECH better.
